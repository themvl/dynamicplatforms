# dynamic-platforms-godot
A plugin to create dynamic platforms in godot using curves.

Currently in development for first release.

A plugin for the godot game engine. It creates platforms using curves using predefined textures for edge, filling and corners. Collision shape is also automaticly created. 

## Explanation/tutorial in progress
There are 2 parts to this plugin. The *tyle editor* and the *dynamicplatform node*. Platforms use styles to define how they look.

### Alternatives and similar plugins

There are some similar plugins for the engine that i am going to list here. I had either problems running them or they didnt have the features and flexibility i wanted so i made my own.
